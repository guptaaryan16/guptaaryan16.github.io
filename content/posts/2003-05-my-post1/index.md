So why do you need to read this blog? Honestly I don’t know myself. I am just a sophomore in Electrical Engineering who found his way into a domain you may be talking about a lot these days i.e Data Science.  I do feel like have way less experience according to the standard perception of the students, like I have not secured an internship or a job(on campus), nor I have won a global hackathon competition (we did win bronze medal in Inter IIT Tech Meet 11.0 Chandrayaan PS but it is far less accomplishment than many at IITR). So in this post, I want to cover the story of my recruitment to DSG, IITR and my experiences and learnings during this whole year.

<br>
So let me tell you something about the what I did during the past year. I completed various YouTube courses( like the famous course Andrew Ng ‘s  ML) , read a million blogs and tried my ways through some of the state-of-the-art research papers(MIT level shit). Also I participated in various hackathons and coding events to enhance my skills during this period. From <a sr="https://Shell.AI">Shell.AI</a> challenge (my first off-campus hackathon) to the Inter IIT tech meet, I feel like these hackathons have given a good exposure to the world of Software Development . This also helped me appreciate the world of Open-Source where I made a few contributions just to be a part of the greater community.

Also I participated in some internal events of DSG which gave me a chance to interact with some of the greatest minds in the campus, from people who are top in the class as well as in ML, the ones that have published papers in UG, who are great at management to some of the most creative people in IITR.

        I gave JEE and then came into IITR.That is the most basic part and needs no details, so let's skip that. I came here and got overwhelmed by the Campus environment . I was a shy guy (still I am)who lost all his social skills owing to the pandemic. On the top of that, what did I do. I isolated from the most stuff like WhatsApp messages as they were hard to read after online classes and focussed on the my general life like going to gym. But one good thing that I did was that I developed an interest for Python, still an important asset to me, during this period.
        <br> Then came the results and I did not get enough CGPA for a branch change as with the most people. This is kind of hard to get and may make you believe you are not good enough, but trust me there are much better things to do in college that just constantly being worried

about a number, no offence to my studious friends whom I am highly dependent during exams.
The period after the first semester was a particularly productive one, where I learnt valuable things that prove to be helpful later on.

## The First Few Lessons

So the first semester-break was a particularly interesting one where we had lots of intro-talks and  workshops owing to Cognizance. I had good interest in following the first few events but by the end of just one to weeks, I had lost interest in them. I just followed those clubs which I found interesting and forgo the rest of them. Although it may be a mistake as I missed out on a lot of interesting clubs due to this.  

Some of the best things I did during this period were as follows: I participated in GGJ (Global Game Jam) and learnt something about game-dev ( although I turned out to hate it ), participated in ML and DL workshops, auth and POSTMAN API among others. These workshops provided a good base for me to work on for various Tech Club recruitments although I was unsure about myself during this whole period.

## The Main Clubs I chose and Interviews

So after this period,  I realised that I liked working in web-dev and data science projects, I attended a few bootcamps in the same and that helped me start some basic projects like developing a small game in python and writing few web apps. These small things helped me overcome an initial inertia in the programming world and helped me learn important things like Python OOPs, git and REST-APIs and also something about basic ML. Now having worked on all these things, I  participated in some on-campus hackathons like SDSLabs hackathon and other coding events in the campus. This helped me gain valuable experience about how things were conducted in the campus. At last I selected two clubs to be very important for me i.e., SDSLabs and DSG. Both very really good in their projects and GitHub setup and had some 'charm' in the campus.

My interview in the SDSLabs got confirmed due to my Makers project in which I tried to build a Twitter bot that can read Elon Musk's tweets and find the sentiment analysis regarding Tesla stocks or Cryptocurrency like DogeCoin. Mind you can say it is a bit complicated and treat me as a OG but really it was stupid in its implementation and can be improved greatly if I worked on it now. But that is just the way open source works and you will learn a lot while building such projects.

This interview was a game-changer for me. You probably think I passed with flying colours but I failed miserably ;-) . In this interview, I was grilled so well that I changed a lot of my ways after that. What was those questions ? Mostly were based on Flask, on which the Twitter bot was developed. The problem was I just followed the tutorials without much understanding of the Flask project or the APIs and that did not help my case. I was a bit naive( still am ) to assume that my experience was sufficient but it was not. Still I would say it helped me a lot in the long run as I changed my approach to learn software development and ML. **I escaped the 'Tutorial-Hell' and started following all documentation very seriously which is very important for any developer.**

Next I sat for the interview at DSG IITR. While I was very less familiar with data science, I had some expertise in Python and liked reading data science based online articles. I had not completed any major data science courses though. So the interview was initially very difficult and due to less knowledge in the relevant areas was kind of hard for me. But there was something I felt different about these interviews. They were interesting enough and had me though in a very different way than I was familiar with. I had to come up with mathematical interpretations for ML models and probabilities which was difficult yet exciting. And something made me go through them with less problems than previous experiences and I came out to be a proud member of this new community.

## What I gained from my experience at DSG

My experience at DSG was really valuable for me. I came to be a part of this 'nerdy' yet exciting community which helped me in many ways as possible. From providing great learning resources in areas relevant to Data science to some dreaded nerdy discussion sessions, the atmosphere fills you with a kind of responsibility and fun at the same time. You may have some inhibitions initially but they all go away as we make our way to form great friendships and experiences. This journey turned me from a 'noob' programmer to a data scientist and helped me gain enough confidence in the field. I hope that my this year till the Inter-IIT phase will have positive impact on my life and help me in the future.
