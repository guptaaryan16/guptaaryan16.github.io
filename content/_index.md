I am Aryan Gupta, a Final year Electrical Engineering major at IIT Roorkee. I am also a passionate Open Source/Software Engineer with a strong interest in ML and Deep Learning systems.

I contribute to scientific python packages with interests in projects like PyTorch, MLX and Diffusers. I really like ML Ops and like working on hard problems in this domain.
