Hi all! I am Aryan Gupta, currently a final year student in Electrical Enginnering major, at [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/). I chose my major after seeing the Iron Man movies and reading the comics, as it seemed really cool to work with circuits and build stuff.

As for my experience, I first did an internship at Quansight labs, the maintainers of most scientific Python packages, which helped me learn and meet some of the most important people in the field. Afterwards I started building projects and packages for myself, and my clubs at Uni, which helped me learn a lot too.

Besides ML, I am a big fan of general software development, especially in the PyData ecosystem. I studied C and C++ as well in college and had a good time with Data Structures and Algorithms. I am now trying to learn the advanced features and CUDA programming which seems important in the age of big "LLMs". I have also participated in the ML reproducibility challenge 2023 and have done some research on Double Sampling Randomized Smoothing along with the original authors.

Currently I am working a lot on some open source contributions for Diffusers and working at High speed inference using Apple M series GPUS with the MLX framework. I love the idea of making ML accessible for all people!

Thanks for reading about me. ðŸ¤—
